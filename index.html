<p>Solid State Drives (SSDs) have revolutionized the way we store and access data, offering lightning-fast speeds and enhanced reliability. However, like any electronic device, SSDs require proper monitoring and maintenance to ensure they continue to perform optimally over time.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: This article is in reference to Transcend embedded SSD products.</strong></p>
<h2 id="SMART-Technology"><a href="#SMART-Technology" class="headerlink" title="SMART Technology"></a>SMART Technology</h2><p>One of the most significant advancements in drive monitoring is SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology). This groundbreaking feature is integrated within modern hard drives and SSDs, providing them with a level of self-awareness previously unseen.</p>
<h2 id="SMART-Parameters-for-SSD-Health-Monitoring"><a href="#SMART-Parameters-for-SSD-Health-Monitoring" class="headerlink" title="SMART Parameters for SSD Health Monitoring"></a>SMART Parameters for SSD Health Monitoring</h2><p>SMART technology provides valuable insights into the health status of SSDs by tracking various usage parameters.<br>For Transcend embedded SSDs, the following parameters are particularly relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="A9-Percentage-Field-Represents-the-health-percentage-for-SATA-SSDs"><a href="#A9-Percentage-Field-Represents-the-health-percentage-for-SATA-SSDs" class="headerlink" title="A9 (Percentage) Field: Represents the health percentage for SATA SSDs."></a>A9 (Percentage) Field: Represents the health percentage for SATA SSDs.</h3></li>
<li><h3 id="05-Percentage-Used-Field-Represents-the-percentage-of-life-used-for-NVMe-SSDs"><a href="#05-Percentage-Used-Field-Represents-the-percentage-of-life-used-for-NVMe-SSDs" class="headerlink" title="05 (Percentage Used) Field: Represents the percentage of life used for NVMe SSDs."></a>05 (Percentage Used) Field: Represents the percentage of life used for NVMe SSDs.</h3></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/SATA-A9.png" alt="SATA-A9"><br><img src="/images/NVMe-05.png" alt="NVMe-05"></p>
<p>These fields are key indicators of the SSDâ€™s overall health and remaining lifespan.</p>
<p>In addition to health percentages, SMART technology also monitors the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Temperature:the temperature of the SSD during operation.</li>
<li>Read and Write Operation Metrics: the number of read and write operations performed.</li>
<li>Power-On Hours: the total number of hours the SSD has been powered on.</li>
<li>Unexpected Power Interruptions: unexpected power interruptions, which can impact the SSDâ€™s stability and data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To monitor the health of Transcend embedded SSDs, focus on interpreting the A9 and 05 fields, which correspond to health percentages for SATA and NVMe SSDs respectively. </p>
<p>The following github project provides to build executable file in Linux for Transcend embedded SSD, along with sample code for reference. The procedure can also be used as a reference for non-Linux systems.</p>
<p>How to: Monitor SSD health and SMART status in Linux :<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/transcend-information/Linux-SMART-Command">https://github.com/transcend-information/Linux-SMART-Command</a></p>

<p>Monitoring the health of SSDs is crucial for ensuring their optimal performance and longevity. SMART technology plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling storage devices to autonomously monitor and report their operational status. By proactively monitoring these parameters, you can take timely action to maintain the SSDâ€™s performance and reliability.</p>
